# PowerISO For Window

PowerISO is a software application designed for processing ISO files and other disc image formats. An ISO file is a perfect copy of a physical disc, like a CD or DVD, saved as a single file. With PowerISO, you can create, open, edit, convert, compress, and mount these image files. It supports many file formats, including ISO, BIN, NRG, CDI, DAA, and more. This software is widely used by people who want to burn discs, create bootable USB drives, or simply organize their disc images on a computer.

- Create and Burn ISO Files
PowerISO allows you to create ISO files from files and folders on your computer. You can also burn ISO files directly to CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray discs. This makes it easy to create backup copies of your important discs or share data on physical media.

- Open and Extract Image Files
With PowerISO, you don’t need to burn an image file to a disc to access its contents. The software can open and extract files from ISO and other supported image formats quickly, saving you time and effort.

- Mount ISO Files as Virtual Drives
One of the most convenient features of PowerISO is its ability to mount ISO files as virtual drives. This means you can use an ISO file like a real disc without needing a physical drive. It’s great for running software, installing games, or accessing data stored in ISO files.
